  <div class="All about school">
    <p> School is extremely annoying. The teachers are always teaching.
       I like sports and I like doing my work and getting things done.
       School can be fun sometimes but not all the time.
       I like the food that we are given sometimes because it can be tasty.
       The lunch ladies are so nice to me becauseI am always eating
       The teachers are probably annoyed with me because I am always asking qustions</p>
